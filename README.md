# Machine-Learning-Internship-
Movies Reviews Sentiments
## Usage

1. Download the "IMDB Dataset.csv" file and place it in the same directory as the code.
2. Run the code in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.
3. The code will train a Logistic Regression model and a Gaussian Naive Bayes model on the data.
4. It will then evaluate the models' performance and print the results.
5. The trained Logistic Regression model and the TfidfVectorizer will be saved as "model.pkl" and "scaler.pkl", respectively.

## Results

The project achieves high accuracy in classifying movie reviews as positive or negative. You can find the detailed results in the output of the code.
